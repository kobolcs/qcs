# Project Vision: Web3 & Smart Contract Quality Assurance

**Status: Experimental – Work in Progress**

This project demonstrates advanced testing techniques for Web3 applications, focusing on the unique quality assurance challenges presented by blockchain and smart contracts.

It serves as R&D for clients exploring decentralized finance and other emerging Web3 opportunities.

### When to Use This Technology

This stack (`Solidity`, `Hardhat`, `Ethers.js`) is the industry standard for developing and testing applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and other compatible blockchains. This testing approach is critical when:

* **Value is at Stake**: Smart contracts often control significant financial assets. Bugs are not just errors; they can lead to irreversible, catastrophic financial loss.
* **Security is Paramount**: The immutable nature of blockchains means that security vulnerabilities cannot be easily "patched." Testing for common exploits like reentrancy, integer overflows, and access control issues is non-negotiable.
* **Gas Efficiency Matters**: Every operation on a blockchain costs "gas" (a transaction fee). Inefficient code is expensive code. Gas reporting during tests is a crucial performance optimization step.

### Strategic Advantage
- Demonstrates how to safeguard high-value smart contracts before they are deployed.
- Includes gas usage assertions to help control ongoing transaction costs.
- Architectural foundations are outlined in [../../ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md](../../ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md).

### Similar Tooling in Other Languages
* **Framework Alternatives**: `Truffle` (JavaScript-based) and `Foundry` (Solidity-based) are popular alternatives to `Hardhat` for smart contract development and testing.
* **Other Blockchains**: Different blockchains have their own native languages and testing frameworks (e.g., `Rust + Anchor` for Solana). However, the principles of unit testing, security analysis, and resource management are universal.

### Installation and Running

**Prerequisites:**
* Node.js (version 18.x or later)
* (Optional) Docker

#### 1. Local Machine (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd prototypes/blockchain-smart-contracts-tests
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Compile the smart contracts**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
4.  **Run the tests** (this will automatically start a local Hardhat Network):
    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

#### 2. Docker

1.  **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t blockchain-tests .
    ```
2.  **Run the tests inside the container**:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm blockchain-tests
    ```








### Vulnerability & Gas Usage Testing

The test suite includes examples for reentrancy and integer overflow to illustrate common security flaws. Gas consumption is tracked with `hardhat-gas-reporter`, and key operations assert that gas usage stays within reasonable limits.

## Client Scenarios

- Gas usage assertions identified an inefficiency that would have increased transaction costs by 15%. For a DeFi platform processing 50k transactions per month, that equates to roughly **€7.5k saved each month**.
- Early detection of reentrancy vulnerabilities prevented high-severity security risks that could lock customer funds.
