# Architectural Principles

This suite follows a set of patterns that keep test code scalable and easy to maintain across languages.

## Scalability
- **Parallel execution** reduces runtime (e.g., Go's `t.Parallel`, Robot Framework's `pabot`).
- **Containerized dependencies** isolate services and scale easily in CI.

## Maintainability
- **Dependency injection and page objects** decouple test logic from infrastructure.
- **Consistent formatting and linting** (see [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md)) make cross-team contributions straightforward.

## Robustness
- **Retry and backoff logic** handles flaky external systems.
- **Automated reporting** produces clear HTML or JSON artifacts for every run.
- **Security and coverage checks** surface risks early.

Adhering to these principles typically cuts regression time by more than 50% and lowers support costs by preventing brittle test suites.
